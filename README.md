iBeacons-iOS-Example
====================

A showcase on how to setup an iBeacon on an iOS device, and how to monitor them. This simple app can be setup as iBeacon peripheral or as iBeacon region monitor.

This example was used during the Mobel meetup hackathon on NFC and iBeacons to show how beacons work on iOS.
